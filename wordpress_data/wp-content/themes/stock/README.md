Stock

---

Hi. I'm a simple, minimalist theme called `stock`, based on `underscores`.

Here are some interesting things you'll find here:

* So RTL, much wow
* Accessible
* Responsive
* Custom background
* Custom feature colours
* Editor styling
* Featured images
* Stuff like that


If you find something you don't like, or could be improved, feel free to contribute!
